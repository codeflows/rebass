- Parser numbers as Numbers that just retain the original string as
  their content (to retain precision). These can be then converted to
  actual numbers if need be.
- Support chunks of data inside nodes (they seem base64-encoded?)
- Acceptance tests: parse -> serialize -> compare to original for actual Reaper project files
- Split stuff under src/ and test/
